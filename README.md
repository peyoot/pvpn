How to set up VPN
----
You need to have a vps on cloud or have a server with public IP. If you don't have one, simply buy one from any cloud service provider like AWS/Azure/Alicloud. Some cloud service provider can provide you one year free service so you can give it a try. 

Scripts have been tested with Ubuntu 18.04. Other version of Ubuuntu or Debian may work but not garantee. For client side, you can use windows, mac , android. use the the client certs generated by scripts in server and put it in the right place.

You simply need to run the same script in server or client PC. <br>
sudo ./install_vpn.sh <br>

And then follow the instruction to select server/client mode and VPN type. Most of the time you only need to press "Enter" key follow the prompts. 
But you'll need to input "yes" in the server/client certs generation process.
Also when you install client mode. You'll need to input server's IP so that the scripts know how to set up configure files for you.

PVPN scripts will help you generated every thing serer needed and also generated a client certification for the use in home or office PC/laptop. You can download client certs directly from server via web browser.
All necessary certs,config files,scripts in Ubuntu server/client will be generated automatically.
If you use it in Windows/Mac/Android, you'll need to install openvpn/stunnel manually and put certs/config by yourselves.
